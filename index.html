          <p>The Cardigan is a long,
            low dog with upright ears
            and a fox brush tail.[6]
            The old American Kennel Club
            standard called it an "Alsatian
            on short legs".[citation needed]
            The Cardigan's tail is long
            (unlike the Pembroke Welsh corgi,
            whose tail may be long,[7] naturally
            bobbed or docked[8]). Cardigans come
            in a variety of colors including
            any shade of red, sable, or brindle,
            as well as black, with or without tan,
            brindle or blue merle, with or without
            tan or brindle points. Other unofficial
            colors can occur, such as red merle, but
            these colors are not considered acceptable per
            the Cardigan standard. They usually have white
            on the neck, chest, legs, muzzle, underneath,
            tip of the tail and as a blaze on the head,
            known as the "Irish pattern."[citation needed]
            Other markings include ticking on the legs and muzzle,
            smutty muzzles and monk's hoods, especially on sables
            (a pattern of darker tipped hairs over a basic red coat
            color.[citation needed]. An average Cardigan is around
            10.5 to 13 inches (260 to 315 mm) tall at the withers
            and weighs from 30 to 38 lb. (13.6 to 17.2 kg) for the
            male and 25 to 34 lb. (11.3 to 15.4 kg) for the female.
